# bibuscord-status

So this is supposed to be a program where you can do cool custom discord "rich presence" stuff using pypresence.
In fact, it'll take a LOT to do it for me, so if you're somehow interested you can join [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/KDYPF8Skht) and pm me to contact.


## Todo

- [ ] Make a version that will work with the weather parser and PC resources monitor | Make the version stable(optional)
- [ ] Add more functionality possibilities.
- [ ] Make the program start with startup.
- [ ] Make program changes depending on the opened pyCharm etc.
- [ ] Make simple UI.
- [ ] Improve code structure.
- [ ] Add a second wave of features.
